As UCLA students, it takes us almost 20 minutes to walk to class from our dorms. This time adds up, meaning at the very least, we spend a minimum of an hour of our day every day just walking. This is valuable time just wasted, spent on walking.

What if we could be productive and reclaim these lost hours during our day?
